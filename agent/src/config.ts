// script's `contract/e2e/.state` so the two never contend for the same

// Per-company agent separation (roadmap milestone 1, see HANDOFF.md §4).

// The demo runs one process hosting all four parties. In production each
// enterprise runs its own agent hosting exactly one party (see agent/API.md's
// opening paragraph) — `AGENT_PARTIES` is what switches between the two:
// unset, it defaults to every party (today's demo/Preprod behavior,
// unchanged); set to a comma-separated subset (e.g. `AGENT_PARTIES=mine`),
// bootstrap.ts only builds wallets/providers for that subset, so this
// process never touches the other companies' secrets. Every route that
// resolves a party through `appState.parties` (i.e. every route except
// `/admin/suppliers`, which also needs OTHER companies' public partyId — see
// registry.ts's `partyId()`) is automatically scoped by this: a party this
// process does not host is simply not in that map.
