// Veilance Party Agent — the job queue.
//
// Every circuit call is proving + balancing + submit + finality (20-45s per
// contract/e2e/REPORT.md). The local proof server can only usefully do one
// proof at a time, so ALL circuit calls — across all four parties — share
// ONE global, strictly sequential queue. Handlers return 202 with the queued
// Job immediately; this module drains the queue in the background and
// persists every stage transition to the acting party's agent.json.
